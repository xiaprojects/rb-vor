"""Cap numeric-library thread pools to one thread. Import BEFORE numpy/scipy.

Reference: field bug, 2026-07-25 -- the daemon pegged 100% on all four Pi cores
while doing perhaps 4% of real work.

Cause: the polyphase FIR (`wins @ taps` in dsp.py) and the scipy filters hand
off to the platform BLAS (OpenBLAS on Raspberry Pi OS). OpenBLAS defaults to one
worker thread per core and **busy-waits** between calls, so a single-threaded
1 Hz DSP shows up as every core at 100%. On a 4-core Pi that also steals cycles
from the SDR reader thread, which can starve the pipeline.

For this workload the matrices are tiny (a few thousand elements); threading them
is pure overhead. Pinning every backend to one thread drops CPU to a few percent
of one core with no change in output.

This must run before numpy is imported, because OpenBLAS reads these variables at
load time. `rbvor/__main__.py` imports this module first, ahead of everything.
